To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.

To stress C compilers with unusual code.
To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.

okay

Compiles and runs correctly under linux (32 and 64 bit), windows using
mingw and MACOS X (using Apple's gcc)

Microsoft doesn't support C99
  * change uint32_t to unsigned __int32
  * change uint64_t to unsigned __int64
  * replace #include<inttypes.h> with #define PRIX64 "%ull"

Make initial #defines say something? 9 letters
  * MERSN_PM
  * PRIMESGUD
  * PRIMES_OK


Read times to check each prime in, make formula then extrapolate.
Graph cycle time?

Remove loop around mersenne_initialise - should be able to calculate the fft size straight off
for p, need n such that ceil(n/p)*2+log2(n) <= 63?

FIXME could use top bit of each fft element as a guard bit?  There should never be an overflow into it
Could then test by squaring 2^p-1

NOTES runs much faster when compiled with 64 bit compiler, but should compile and run under any C99 compiler.

We strongly encourage the use of Markdown in submitted remarks and documentation!

FIXME doesn't work under lenny becaue of py2.5 feature

DONE Add 0 check for definitely prime!

DONE fix compiler warning

hints file
  * is that a picture of a monk?  Who could it be?
  * wait, is that an inscription?

DONE Remove ?0:1 conditional?

DONE Write test suite

Try 32 bit compiler.  Try other compilers, eg intel, tinycc...

DONE Validate the program fits the rules

Extra spaces after defines?

DONE Remove trailing spaces

DONE Can replace if(

NOT DONE - doesn't work can use ;if( and ;for( to save a few more bytes!

DONE Need to localise variables more so use the free single digit variables for local variables

DONE Can remove most of the casts most likely

DONE Calculate root1 and root2?

DONE Use ARMprime code in C to prove some Mersenne primes

./mersenne 23209 10
Testing 2**23209-1 with fft size 2**10 for 23207 iterations
Initialising...Done
Testing exponent 23209
That took 27.4 seconds for 23207 iterations, ie 0.00118068 seconds/iteration
Residue is 0x0000000000000000
