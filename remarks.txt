Remarks
=======

This should compile on any compiler which supports "inttypes.h" from
the C99 standard (eg gcc).

It runs a lot quicker when compiled as a 64 bit binary!

I have successfully compiled and run this program without changes or
compiler warnings for:

  * 64 bit Ubuntu Linux 11.10
  * 32 bit Debian Linux (Lenny)
  * Windows using [MINGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
  * OS X 10.7 using Apple's gcc based compiler

If you don't have a compiler which supports inttypes.h from C99 (hello
it is 2012 Microsoft!) then you'll need to go platform specific:

  * comment out the `#include <inttypes.h>` line
  * change the `#define` for `uint32_t` to be an unsigned 32 bit type
    `unsigned int` or `unsigned __int32`
  * change the `#define` for `uint64_t` to be an unsigned 64 bit type
    `unsigned long long` or `unsigned __int64`
  * add `#define PRIX64 "llX"` or `"lX"` or `"I64X"`
