IOCCC 2012 Entry
================

This was my entry for the 21st [International Obfuscated C Code Contest](http://www.ioccc.org/).

Unfortunately it didn't win.

I've [written it up](http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/ioccc-2012-mersenne-prime-checker/)
 on my web site.  There you'll find out how it works and what it does.

If you just want to look at some obfuscated C then look [here](https://github.com/ncw/ioccc2012/blob/master/prog.c) ;-)
